Refactor API routing and enhance authentication flow


This commit improves API organization and user authentication handling across the platform.


Backend Changes

API Route Restructuring
The olandinvestmentsapi endpoints now live under a dedicated api prefix. This creates a cleaner separation between internal routes and public API endpoints. All API calls to this service now route through /api/ instead of the root path.

Test Data Generation
Added two utility scripts for creating test data. The simple version generates a three-level category hierarchy with test summaries. The comprehensive version includes six fully implemented test scripts covering equity valuation, financial ratios, trend analysis, momentum indicators, mean reversion strategies, and portfolio risk analysis.


Frontend Changes

Profile Authentication Guard
The Profile component now validates user authentication on mount. When a user lacks valid credentials, the application redirects them to the login page. This prevents unauthorized access to user profile data.

Null Safety Improvements
Added optional chaining throughout the Profile component to handle cases where user data might be unavailable. The component now degrades gracefully when user information is incomplete rather than throwing runtime errors.

Query Optimization
Updated the authentication token query to skip execution when credentials are missing. This prevents unnecessary API calls and improves performance during the initial application load.


Impact

These changes establish a more robust authentication flow and create a foundation for better API versioning. The test data scripts enable rapid development iteration without manual database setup.

Technical Details

The routing change affects all API consumers. Internal services continue to use root-level routes while external API calls now require the /api/ prefix. This separation improves security boundaries and enables future versioning strategies.

Authentication checks now occur before component mounting completes. The redirect happens immediately when credentials are invalid, preventing any unauthorized data fetching attempts.

The test data scripts use Django ORM for database operations. Both scripts are idempotent and can run multiple times without creating duplicate data. The comprehensive script includes complete financial analysis implementations suitable for development testing.
