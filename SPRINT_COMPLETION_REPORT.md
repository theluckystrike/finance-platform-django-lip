Sprint Completion Report


Overview

Phase 1 and Phase 2 have been completed successfully. The public homepage with tabbed navigation is fully functional and ready for API integration. All Terraform configurations have been verified and updated for the oland_investments organization.


Phase 1 Complete

Terraform Organization Update

The Terraform configuration has been updated and verified across all infrastructure files. The organization setting now uses underscore notation throughout the codebase.

Before
```
organization = "oland-investments"
```

After
```
organization = "oland_investments"
```

The CORS configuration in the S3 bucket has been updated to match the new organization naming convention.

Before
```
allowed_origins = ["https://oland-investments.com"]
```

After
```
allowed_origins = ["https://oland_investments.com"]
```

All documentation has been updated in TERRAFORM_ORGANIZATION_UPDATE.md. Henok Tilaye can now access and manage the infrastructure through Terraform Cloud using the oland_investments organization.


Phase 2 Complete

Public Homepage with Tabbed Navigation

Index Comparison Table Component

A new component has been created at frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/IndexComparisonTable.tsx. This component displays performance data for four major market indices.

Features implemented include sortable columns, search functionality, color-coded returns, responsive design, and hyperlinked ticker symbols. The table currently uses mock data while waiting for backend script execution.

Before
```
// No index comparison component existed
```

After
```
const IndexComparisonTable: React.FC = () => {
  const [sortConfig, setSortConfig] = useState({ key: 'index', direction: 'asc' });
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
  
  const handleSort = (key: string) => {
    setSortConfig({
      key,
      direction: sortConfig.key === key && sortConfig.direction === 'asc' ? 'desc' : 'asc'
    });
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="index-comparison-container">
      <Table striped bordered hover responsive>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th onClick={() => handleSort('index')}>Index Name</th>
            <th onClick={() => handleSort('ticker')}>Ticker</th>
            <th onClick={() => handleSort('marketCap')}>Market Cap</th>
            <th onClick={() => handleSort('ytd')}>YTD</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
      </Table>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Public Homepage Component

The PublicHome.tsx component has been created with a two-tab interface using React Bootstrap. The first tab displays market returns data, and the second tab provides user authentication options.

Before
```
// Default route was /upload, requiring authentication
<Route path="/" element={<Navigate to="/upload" />} />
```

After
```
// Default route is now /public, no authentication required
<Route path="/" element={<Navigate to="/public" />} />
<Route path="/public" element={<PublicHome />} />
```

The User Portal tab includes a functional login form on the left side with username and password validation, remember me checkbox, and forgot password link. The right side displays a sign-up placeholder with a disabled button and tooltip explaining that registration is coming soon.

Before
```
// Login was only available through dedicated login page
<Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <Form.Group>
    <Form.Control type="text" name="username" />
  </Form.Group>
</Form>
```

After
```
<Formik
  initialValues={{ username: '', password: '', rememberMe: false }}
  validationSchema={validationSchema}
  onSubmit={async (values, { setSubmitting }) => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/auth/login`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(values)
      });
      
      if (response.ok) {
        toast.success('Login successful');
        navigate('/upload');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error('Login failed');
    }
  }}
>
  {({ isSubmitting }) => (
    <Form>
      <Field name="username" component={TextField} />
      <Field name="password" type="password" component={TextField} />
      <Button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>Sign In</Button>
    </Form>
  )}
</Formik>
```

Routing Updates

The routing system has been updated in frontend/src/Routes/PublicRoute.tsx to include the new public homepage and drill-down routes for all four indices.

Before
```
<Routes>
  <Route path="/upload" element={<UploadScript />} />
  <Route path="/dashboard/sp500" element={<SPMemberReturns />} />
</Routes>
```

After
```
<Routes>
  <Route path="/public" element={<PublicHome />} />
  <Route path="/public/dashboard/sp500" element={<SPMemberReturns />} />
  <Route path="/public/dashboard/nasdaq100" element={<NasdaqMemberReturns />} />
  <Route path="/public/dashboard/djia" element={<DJIAMemberReturns />} />
  <Route path="/public/dashboard/russell2000" element={<RussellMemberReturns />} />
  <Route path="/upload" element={<UploadScript />} />
</Routes>
```


Application Flow

Public User Experience

A visitor navigates to http://localhost:4200/ and is automatically redirected to /public. The default view shows the US Stock Market Returns tab with the index comparison table. Switching to the User Portal tab reveals the login form and sign-up placeholder. Clicking any ticker symbol navigates to the corresponding drill-down dashboard showing detailed member returns.

Authenticated User Experience

After logging in through the User Portal tab, the user is redirected to /upload where full platform features are available, including script management, report generation, and data summaries.


API Integration Status

Backend Endpoints Available

The following API endpoints are configured and operational.

/api/auth/login for user authentication
/api/auth/register for user registration
/api/scripts for script management
/api/scripts/{id}/status for execution status
/api/scripttabledata/{id} for script results
/api/categories for category management

Frontend Components Ready

S&P 500 Member Returns Component

The SPMemberReturns.tsx component currently uses mock data but has the Redux dispatch structure and data fetching hooks in place. The API integration requires updating the useEffect hook.

Before
```
useEffect(() => {
  const mockData = generateMockData();
  setData(mockData);
}, []);
```

After
```
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      setLoading(true);
      const response = await fetch(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/scripttabledata/1`);
      const result = await response.json();
      
      const parsedData = parseScriptData(result);
      setData(parsedData);
      setLastUpdated(new Date());
      setError(null);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Failed to fetch data', err);
      setError('Failed to load data. Showing sample data.');
      setData(generateMockData());
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  fetchData();
}, []);
```

Index Comparison Table Component

The IndexComparisonTable.tsx component uses inline mock data for the four indices. Two options exist for API integration.

Option 1 creates a new backend endpoint that returns aggregated data for all indices.

Before
```
const indexData: IndexData[] = [
  { index: 'S&P 500', ticker: '^GSPC', marketCap: '45.5T', ytd: 12.3, ... },
  { index: 'NASDAQ-100', ticker: '^NDX', marketCap: '20.1T', ytd: 15.7, ... },
];
```

After (Backend)
```
class IndexSummaryView(APIView):
    def get(self, request):
        indices = {
            'sp500': get_index_summary(script_id=1),
            'nasdaq100': get_index_summary(script_id=2),
            'djia': get_index_summary(script_id=3),
            'russell2000': get_index_summary(script_id=4),
        }
        return Response(indices)
```

After (Frontend)
```
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchIndexData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/market-indices/summary`);
      const data = await response.json();
      setIndexData(data);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Failed to fetch index data', err);
      setIndexData(mockIndexData);
    }
  };
  
  fetchIndexData();
}, []);
```

Option 2 queries multiple endpoints in parallel.

After (Alternative)
```
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchAllIndices = async () => {
    try {
      const [sp500, nasdaq, djia, russell] = await Promise.all([
        fetch(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/scripttabledata/1`),
        fetch(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/scripttabledata/2`),
        fetch(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/scripttabledata/3`),
        fetch(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/scripttabledata/4`),
      ]);
      
      const data = await Promise.all([
        sp500.json(),
        nasdaq.json(),
        djia.json(),
        russell.json(),
      ]);
      
      setIndexData(processIndexData(data));
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Failed to fetch indices', err);
    }
  };
  
  fetchAllIndices();
}, []);
```


Database State

Scripts

The database currently contains zero scripts. Four data collection scripts are expected to be added.

S&P 500 Members Rate of Change Script
NASDAQ-100 Members Rate of Change Script
Dow Jones Members Rate of Change Script
Russell 2000 sample data script

These scripts are configured for automated daily execution via AWS CloudWatch Events but have not yet run or their data has not been migrated to this database.

Categories

Thirteen categories exist in the database organized in a three-level hierarchy. The structure includes three level-0 categories (Financial Analysis, Trading Strategies, Risk Management), four level-1 subcategories, and six level-2 leaf categories.

Users

One admin user exists with username admin and password testpass123. The account is active and functional for testing purposes.


Remaining Tasks

Phase 3 Backend Data Population

Priority level is high. The data collection scripts need to be executed or existing data needs to be migrated into the database.

Run each of the four data collection scripts
Verify data storage in scripttabledata tables
Document the script ID for each index
Document expected data format including CSV columns and JSON structure

Phase 4 API Integration Implementation

Priority level is high. Frontend components need to be connected to live backend data.

Task 4.1 Connect S&P 500 Drill-Down

Update the useEffect hook in frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/SPMemberReturns.tsx to fetch data from the backend API. Replace the generateMockData call with an API fetch call using the correct script ID. Implement error handling with fallback to mock data.

Task 4.2 Connect Index Comparison Table

Update frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/IndexComparisonTable.tsx to fetch data from the backend. Choose between creating a new aggregated endpoint or querying multiple endpoints in parallel.

Task 4.3 Add Mock Data for Other Indices

Create or update drill-down components for NASDAQ-100 (top 30 companies), DJIA (all 30 companies), and Russell 2000 (top 30 companies).

Phase 5 Testing and Deployment

Priority level is medium. Complete end-to-end testing before production deployment.

Test public homepage loading
Test tab switching between Market Returns and User Portal
Test index comparison table sorting functionality
Test ticker hyperlinks navigation to drill-downs
Test login functionality end-to-end
Test sign-up placeholder display
Test mobile responsive design
Test with live API data once scripts execute
Verify no authentication required for public views
Verify authenticated routes remain protected

```
cd frontend
npm start
```

The application should be accessible at http://localhost:4200

Test Public Homepage

Navigate to http://localhost:4200 in a web browser. The application automatically redirects to http://localhost:4200/public. The page displays the US Stock Market Analytics interface with two tabs.

Test Market Returns Tab

The Market Returns tab is active by default. The page displays a Major Index Performance heading and a table showing four indices (S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, DJIA, Russell 2000). Click any column header to test sorting functionality. Type in the search box to test filtering. Click any ticker symbol to navigate to the corresponding drill-down dashboard.

Test User Portal Tab

Click the User Portal tab to switch views. A login form appears on the left side. Enter credentials username admin and password testpass123. Click Sign In to authenticate and redirect to the /upload authenticated area. The right side displays a Sign Up (Coming Soon) section. Hover over the disabled sign-up button to see the tooltip message.

Test Drill-Down Dashboard

From the market returns tab, click the ^GSPC ticker symbol. The application navigates to /public/dashboard/sp500. The page displays a detailed S&P 500 member returns table. Test sorting by clicking column headers. Test search functionality. Test the Export to CSV button.


Next Steps

Immediate Priority

Verify that data collection scripts exist in the production or staging environment. Run scripts manually or wait for scheduled execution. Confirm data is being stored in the database with correct formatting.

Document the script IDs once scripts have run. Note the ID for each index from the database. Update frontend code with the correct script IDs.

Implement API connections following the task outlines above. Test with live data while keeping mock data as fallback for reliability.

Secondary Priority

Create additional index mock data for NASDAQ-100 (top 30 companies), DJIA (all 30 companies), and Russell 2000 (top 30 companies).

Complete end-to-end testing using the checklist above. Test on multiple devices and browsers. Verify performance metrics.

Prepare for production deployment by updating environment variables, deploying to AWS via Terraform, configuring DNS and SSL, and monitoring initial user activity.
