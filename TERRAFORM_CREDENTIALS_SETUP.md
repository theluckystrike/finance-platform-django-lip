**Terraform Cloud Credentials Setup**

The deployment requires two sensitive credentials to be configured in Terraform Cloud before running terraform plan. This setup enables the RDS database connection and email functionality through AWS SES.

Workspace  
https://app.terraform.io/app/oland_investments/oland_investments-prod/variables

---

**RDS Password**

Variable name `rds_password`  
Type Terraform variable (sensitive)  
Workspace oland_investments-prod

The password was set during initial database provisioning. If you don't have this password recorded, reset it through AWS Console.

Current State

```hcl
# Terraform Cloud Variables - BEFORE
# rds_password = (missing or unknown)
```

**Reset the password**

Open AWS Console and navigate to RDS, then Databases. Select your database instance and click Modify. Enter a new password in the master password field and save the change. Record this password securely.

Add the password to Terraform Cloud by navigating to the workspace variables page and updating the `rds_password` variable. Mark it as sensitive.

Expected State

```hcl
# Terraform Cloud Variables - AFTER
rds_password = "your-new-secure-password"  # marked as sensitive
```

---

**SES SMTP Credentials**

Variable names `email_user` and `email_password`  
Type Terraform variables (sensitive)  
Workspace oland_investments-prod

These are specific SMTP credentials generated by AWS SES. They differ from standard AWS access keys.

Current State

```hcl
# Terraform Cloud Variables - BEFORE
# email_user = (missing)
# email_password = (missing)
```

**Generate SMTP credentials**

Open AWS Console and navigate to SES, then Account Dashboard. Click SMTP Settings in the left menu. Select Create My SMTP Credentials.

AWS generates the credentials once. The username starts with "AK" and the password is a 44-character string. Copy both values immediately.

Add both credentials to Terraform Cloud by navigating to the workspace variables page. Create or update `email_user` with the SMTP username and `email_password` with the SMTP password. Mark both as sensitive.

Expected State

```hcl
# Terraform Cloud Variables - AFTER
email_user     = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"    # marked as sensitive
email_password = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"  # marked as sensitive
```

---

**Verification**

Once configured, verify the following in Terraform Cloud.

All three variables exist in the workspace  
- `rds_password`
- `email_user`  
- `email_password`

Each variable is marked as sensitive  
Each variable contains the correct value

The workspace is oland_investments-prod

Henok can now run terraform plan successfully.
