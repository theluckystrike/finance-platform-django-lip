For the All Scripts page, I will add query parameters to the url so that you can filter by category. The”Save” button should just make a new report with the scripts that are selected by the user, there is already an endpoint for this.

For editing Script Files, you can simply use a PATCH request to the /api/scripts/{id} endpoint to update the file with a new, edited one

On the script details page there is no need for past and present at the moment as far I know. We have not implemented that and don’t need it

On the report detail page you already have all of the API endpoints you need. For updating use /api/reports{id}/update. For view latest you should be linking to the report’s latest_pdf field which is a let field provided by a GET request to /api/reports{id}. These are all in the documentation and already implemented

For Tape summary I still need to discuss this with Jeffrey

I will provide an endpoint for proving a category tree too
