 Hi,



The /api/scripts endpoint already has a query parameter for filtering scripts by their category - 
this is outlined in the documentation. So you can use something like /api/scripts?category=11 to filter for scripts whose category has ID 11.




I have also added the endpoint GET /api/categories/tree which will return a JSON formatted tree of all the categories
 on the website by their ID. If you are storing the categories on the front end with keyval or something similar then you should be 
 able to easily find the names and other data of the categories using their IDs from the tree. Let me know if this format is ok for you.



In terms of the Tape Summary, I think we will need to implement that later on the front end. It will require some new code and 
logic on the back end to make it possible.



I will also add the raw chart data to the chart_data field of Scripts in the API so that you can use it to plot the chart with a front end
library and not an image. It will probably be in CSV format. I will let you know once I finish that.



For now you should be able to add the filtering to the All Scripts page by category using the API.
