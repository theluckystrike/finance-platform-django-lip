Hi Sandeep Srivastava , I have updated the site and added the summary endpoint, they are in the documentation as well.
 You can make summaries and also update them while polling for their status just like a script or report. You can see 
 the arguments required for making a new summary in the documentation but i will explain them here also.

The script table_data property now contains some meta data in a meta field which is in the documentation too. this data 
is only available when you GET a single script. to make a summary, the user need to select a single column from the columns 
available in the meta data of the table. the body of the post request for making a summary then contains a name and list of
 scripts and the column name for each on to be included in the summary

when you make a summary and update it, it will then have a signal_plot_data field which will be have two json objects inside
 it: "data" and "signal sum", these are the x and y axis that need to be plotted using plotly on the page for that summary. 
 you will also need to create a table on that page using the summary meta data too. this contains the last values for each 
 script in the summary and the name of the table column it comes from

I'm not sure if Jeffrey has explained to you how the page for a summary should look, let me know if you need any help with 
what data needs to be displayed there
