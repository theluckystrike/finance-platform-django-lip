# Oland-investment Project

This is a React-based web application designed for efficient development and optimized for production. Below are the instructions on how to get started, run, and build the project.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following software installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 20+  
  You can download the latest version of Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Node.js Version Requirement

Make sure you are using **Node.js version 20 or higher** to avoid compatibility issues. You can check your Node.js version by running:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `Getting Started`

- Install Dependencies
- After cloning the repository, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

### `npm install`

- Running the App
- To start the development server, run:

### `npm start`

- Runs the app in development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in your browser.
- The app will reload automatically if you make any edits to the source files.
- You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

- Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- For more information, see the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

- Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.
- React is bundled and optimized for the best performance.
- The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes for caching purposes.
- The app is ready for deployment.

- For detailed deployment steps, refer to the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

- Optional: Run the Build Locally for Testing
- If you want to serve the build locally to test it before deploying, follow these steps:

- Install the serve package globally (if you haven't already):

### `npm install -g serve`

- Serve the production build locally:

- After running npm run build, use the following command to serve the build folder:

### - `serve -s build`

This will start a local server and serve the production build at http://localhost:5000 by default. You can now test your production build locally to ensure everything works as expected.

## - `Learn More`

You can learn more in the Create React App documentation.
To learn React, check out the React documentation.



### `npm run eject`

**Warning: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot undo this action!**

- This command removes the single build dependency from your project.
- It copies all configuration files and dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them.
- You should only `eject` if you need to customize the build tool and configuration.
