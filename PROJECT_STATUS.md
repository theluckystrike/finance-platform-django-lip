Finance Platform Development Status

Date October 17, 2025
Target Repository https://github.com/Joland51/finance-platform-django


PROJECT SCOPE

The platform creates a public and private site architecture with comprehensive market data visualization and user authentication capabilities.


Public and Private Site Structure

The public site remains accessible without authentication. The private site requires user login and authentication. Clear separation exists between public-facing and authenticated content.


Public Site Tabbed Interface

Two primary tabs appear on the public homepage.

Tab 1 displays US Stock Market Returns. This represents the current dashboard tab, renamed and enhanced. The interface presents a comprehensive market index comparison table with specific features. The table includes Index Name, Index Ticker (hyperlinked), Market Cap (if available), YTD Return, 1 Month Return, 3 Month Return, 6 Month Return, and 1 Year Return.

Each index ticker provides a hyperlink to a drill-down dashboard. Member-level analysis displays in format matching existing site tables. The design enables clear comparison of multiple indices with deep-dive capability.

Tab 2 provides the User Portal. The interface displays standard login credentials. A Sign Up button appears with placeholder message stating "Please check back for more information" for future user registration functionality.


Data Collection Infrastructure

Automated daily collection operates for multiple market indices. The system handles S&P 500 Members (approximately 500 stocks), NASDAQ-100 Members (approximately 100 stocks), DJIA Members (30 stocks), and Russell 2000 Members (sample implementation). AWS-based automation via CloudWatch scheduled tasks executes on a staggered schedule to prevent resource contention.


IMPLEMENTATION STATUS


Completed Accomplishments

Public and Private Site Creation

The backend architecture for public and private access stands complete and deployed. A functional user authentication API handles registration and login operations. Secure JWT token authentication protects sensitive endpoints. The frontend routing structure separates public and authenticated routes effectively. Django admin panel access operates at the admin endpoint. Complete validation rules enforce security standards throughout the system.

The user registration API implements comprehensive validation including email validation, password strength requirements, JWT token generation, and complete Django admin integration. The endpoint accepts POST requests at the auth registration route.


Data Collection Infrastructure

All backend data collection infrastructure achieved production-ready status and full automation. This represents a major accomplishment. Four production-ready scripts operate in the system.

The S&P 500 Members Script carries ID 186 and processes approximately 500 stocks. The NASDAQ-100 Members Script handles approximately 100 stocks. The DJIA Members Script processes 30 stocks. The Russell 2000 Members Script implements a sample of 20 stocks.

AWS automation reached fully configured status. CloudWatch scheduled tasks execute for all four indices on a staggered schedule. The S&P 500 runs at 6pm EST (23:00 UTC). The NASDAQ-100 runs at 6:30pm EST (23:30 UTC). The DJIA runs at 7pm EST (00:00 UTC). The Russell 2000 runs at 7:30pm EST (00:30 UTC).

ECS task configurations allocate appropriate resources. The robust data pipeline ensures current data without manual intervention. The Terraform infrastructure includes complete ECS Task Definitions, configured CloudWatch Event Rules, deployed IAM Roles and Policies, and optimized Resource Allocation.


Backend Authentication System

The system achieved fully functional and secure status. User registration API implements comprehensive validation. Email validation and uniqueness checks operate automatically. Password strength enforcement protects user accounts. JWT token-based authentication secures all private endpoints. Django admin integration provides complete management capabilities.


Frontend Dashboard Infrastructure

The frontend dashboard reached approximately 70 percent completion with substantial progress and core components built.

Completed components include public route structure at the public dashboard path. The DashboardList component displays dashboard cards. The SP500Dashboard component provides sortable columns, search functionality, CSV export capability, and prepared Google AdSense integration. A detailed member-view dashboard for S&P 500 operates fully.

The current state uses mock data pending API connection. The interface displays a card-based layout instead of the required tabbed interface. Only S&P 500 has detailed drill-down view implemented.


Outstanding Implementation Gaps

Public Site Tabbed Interface

This represents the primary outstanding UI gap with high priority status. The public page displays dashboard cards instead of a two-tab interface. No tab structure exists currently.

The required implementation creates a two-tab interface on the public homepage. The first tab displays US Stock Market Returns. The second tab provides User Portal access. Updated routing integrates tabs into the public layout.


US Stock Market Returns Tab

High priority status applies to this component. The table structure does not exist. The dashboard uses a card-based layout. No comparison table shows all four indices side-by-side. Only S&P 500 has drill-down functionality.

Required implementation builds an index comparison table with all required columns. The system implements clickable ticker hyperlinks to member views. The S&P 500 drill-down component serves as template for remaining indices including NASDAQ-100, DJIA, and Russell 2000. Connection to real backend data replaces current mock data usage.


User Portal Tab

High priority status applies. The component remains not integrated into the public homepage. The login page exists at a separate login route. No integration exists into the public site as a tab. No sign-up page appears in the frontend despite backend API availability.

Required implementation creates a User Portal tab component. The interface integrates a login form into the tab. A Sign Up button displays with placeholder message. Connection to existing backend registration API completes the functionality.


Data Integration

High priority incomplete status applies. The frontend uses mock data only. No connection exists to real backend APIs. Scripts remain not uploaded to Django admin. No database contains populated real market data.

Required implementation uploads four Python scripts to Django admin. Script execution populates the database with initial data. API endpoints for script data retrieval become available. All frontend components connect to real API endpoints. End-to-end data flow testing verifies complete functionality.


TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

Backend Stack

The backend implements Django 4.2+ framework. PostgreSQL serves production databases while SQLite handles development. Redis plus RQ (Redis Queue) manages task queuing. JWT authentication through djangorestframework-simplejwt secures endpoints. Django REST Framework with drf-yasg provides API documentation.


Frontend Stack

The frontend implements React 18+ with TypeScript. Redux Toolkit with RTK Query manages state. React Bootstrap provides UI framework components. React Router v6 handles routing. Formik plus Yup validation processes forms.


Infrastructure on AWS

AWS infrastructure deploys on ECS Fargate for container service. CloudWatch Events handles scheduling. RDS PostgreSQL provides database services. S3 stores media files. Application Load Balancer distributes traffic. Terraform defines infrastructure as code.
